## R Case Study

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

About the case study -
•	R library has Palmer Penguins dataset which has three species of penguins with different parameters like flipper length, height, weight, etc.
•	The data set has 344 datapoints.


------------------------------
#Data sets in package ‘palmerpenguins’:

penguins                  Size measurements for adult foraging penguins near
                          Palmer Station, Antarctica

penguins_raw (penguins)   Penguin size, clutch, and blood isotope data for
                          foraging adults near Palmer Station, Antarctica
------------------------------


•	The aim of this project is to find the relation between flipper length and body mass. A guess would be larger the flipper length more the body mass.
•	The same prediction was analyzed using R scattered plot to find the correlation.




# Step 1 
The Penguins Dataset in R Studio can be installed using install.packages(‘palmerpenguins’) and then using it by library(‘palmerpenguins’)
```{r}
install.packages('palmerpenguins')
```

# Step 2 
To use the dataset use the code below.
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
```

# Step 3
Install additional packages for data analysis – tidyvers which contains ggplot2, dplyr, facets, etc.
```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
library('tidyverse')
```

# Step 4
Know your data set – Head gives 6 rows and 8 columns, str shows the internal structure of the dataframe. 
```{r}
head(penguins)
str(penguins)
```

# Step 5
Installed ggplot2 package
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

# Step 6
Created a scattered plot to show the relation between flipper length and body mass.
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point()
```

# Step 7
To change the color of the scattered point to red
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(colour = "red")
```

# Step 8
To mark different colors for different species
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(colour = species))
```
The plot shows that Gentoo penguins are the largest. R has created automatic legends for the plot to help us understand the color coding.

# Step 9
To create different colors and shapes for different species in the scattered plot shape was added in aesthetics.
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species))
```

# Step 10 
Now the subsets of the plot were created for each species using facet wrap.
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species)) + facet_wrap(~species)
```

# Step 11
Now a title was given to our plots 
```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + geom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species)) + facet_wrap(~species) + labs(title = "Palmer Penguins : Body Mass v/s Flipper Length")
```

# Step 12
The analysis was then saved using R Markdown. It is a tool to document analysis in Rstudio.
First the package was installed
```{r}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
